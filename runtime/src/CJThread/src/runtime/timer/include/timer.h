 * (that is, call couroutine_new() in the func of the input timer) encapsulate the function to be executed into
 * a cjthread for execution. The advantage is that when the timer performs a time-consuming operation,
 * a processor is not occupied for a long time under the protection of cjthread timeout mechanism.
 * @attention Invoke the timer created by timer_new. If the timer is no longer used, use timer_release to
 * release the timer.
 * @param dur [IN] The timer is triggered after the dur duration, expressed in nanoseconds.
 * @param period [IN] Indicates whether the timer is a cyclic timer. If period is greater than 0,
 * the timer is cyclic. After the timer is triggered, the period is transferred as the dur of the new timer.
 * period = 0 indicates a non-cyclic timer.
