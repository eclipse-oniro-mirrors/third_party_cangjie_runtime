# Cangjie Programming Language Standard Library API

The Cangjie Programming Language Standard Library (std) is a default library included with the Cangjie SDK installation. The standard library predefines a set of functions, classes, structures, etc., designed to provide commonly used functionalities and utilities, enabling developers to write programs more quickly and efficiently.

The Cangjie Standard Library has three key characteristics and objectives:

- **Ease of Use**: The standard library is distributed with the compiler and toolchain, requiring no additional downloadsâ€”ready to use out of the box.
- **General Functionality**: The standard library offers the most frequently used library capabilities, aiming to solve most fundamental problems for developers.
- **Quality Benchmark**: The standard library strives to set examples and benchmarks in performance, coding style, and other aspects for other Cangjie libraries.

## Usage Guide

In the Cangjie programming language, the standard library consists of several packages, where a package is the smallest compilation unit. Each package can independently produce outputs such as AST (Abstract Syntax Trees) files, static library files, dynamic library files, etc. Packages can define sub-packages, forming a tree-like structure. A package without a parent is called a root package, and the entire tree formed by the root package and its sub-packages (including sub-packages of sub-packages) is called a module. The module's name is the same as the root package and represents the smallest unit for developer releases.

Package import rules are as follows:

- You can import a top-level declaration or definition from a package using the following syntax:

    ```cangjie
    import fullPackageName.itemName
    ```

    Here, `fullPackageName` is the complete path of the package name, and `itemName` is the name of the declaration. For example:

    ```cangjie
    import std.collection.ArrayList
    ```

- If multiple `itemName`s belong to the same `fullPackageName`, you can use:

    ```cangjie
    import fullPackageName.{itemName[, itemName]*}
    ```

    For example:

    ```cangjie
    import std.collection.{ArrayList, HashMap}
    ```

- You can also import all top-level declarations or definitions marked as `public` from the `fullPackageName` package using:

    ```cangjie
    import fullPackageName.*
    ```

    For example:

    ```cangjie
    import std.collection.*
    ```
